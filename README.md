## Propose a topic

We welcome topics to be discussed during the SIG. To propose a topic, open an issue with a brief description of the topic and label it `topic`.

## Bring your own data challenges

Do you have a data handling issue? You can bring your issue to the SIG -- we can look at the issue together and do our best to help you find the most suitable solution.

### What do you need?

 - Open an issue on github and label it `help wanted`.

    - What is your final goal ?

    - Which technologies you are using to store and access the data.

We will discuss your issue during the next SIG meeting.
